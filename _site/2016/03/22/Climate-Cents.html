    <p>After doing a bit of pro bono web work and informal consulting for a friend's startup, it looks like I will get a chance to develop a site from scratch. While I certainly feel like a complete imposter during our meetings, I have been upfront about my experiences to date, and find that my decade of experience  running of a company turns out to be a sort of general asset in an advisory role.</p>

<p>The thing I am most excited about is the chance to work with a real proper UX/UI designer. In the past, I have been the designer or I have been provided with a very bare bones design and given the freedom to dress it up without much guidance. I have no formal design training, just strong opinions and an expensive collection of nice looking books I've picked up from Amazon, so the opportunity to see how a professional works and thinks is exciting. I hope to get to use Sketch a bit too to start wireframing.</p>

<p>Since we are committing to a series of weekly sprints, my workload is about to increase considerably. It will be an interesting test of my ability to multitask programming projects.</p>

<p>Learn more about Climate Cents, the Kickstarter for Climate Change, here by visiting <a href="http://climatecents.org">Climate Cents</a>. It is a very exciting approach to a problem most of us associate with anger, futility and guilt.</p>
